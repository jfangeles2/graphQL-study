1. Each resolver should have its own file in ./resolvers
2. The filename of each resolver should correspond to the schema that they define
3. Access required data from database using context which should have already been handled in index.js
4. Resolvers should only handle data that are non-scalar. It should not handle Int, String, Float, etc. An example in this project is the MainCard type from schema.js which all contains scalar type objects. We do not make a resolver for this type.
5. arr.find(foo) terminates if foo returns true, and returns the match
6. arr.filter(foo) terminates if the the whole array is scanned and returns all matches
